## Reasons for denying a PR

We will automatically deny PRs that:

- Have identical functionality to an existing *Piece*
- Have code that breaks/does not catch errors/etc
- Contain NSFW, NSFL contents or contents we deem to be unacceptable
- Contain hacks/exploits/etc
- Have code that might cause a bot to break the TOS or Ratelimits
- Any reason **WE** feel is valid
